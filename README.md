# Pix2Pix-Satellite-to-Map
using the Pix2Pix architecture, this model takes in a satellite image and returns a top-down map view. Due to severe hardware and time constraints, this model was forced to use pre-trained weights, but given enough time will easily achieve the given results.

Based off Aladdin Persson's implementation of the model.

# Examples
satelite input on top, map version outputed by network on the bottom
